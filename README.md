# dotcontext

Every coding agent gets the same repo-native context via `.context.yaml` — portable across tools, git-visible, local-first.

```
$ context init

## Why

Every LLM coding tool — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Aider — has the same problem: to understand a directory, it reads every file. This wastes tokens, doesn't scale, and means different LLMs working on the same project build no shared understanding of what the code does.

`.context.yaml` files fix this. A lean routing layer at each level of the directory tree. An LLM reads one file and knows what the directory is for, what architectural decisions were made, and where to look next — without opening a single source file.

By default, context files focus on what LLMs actually find useful: **summaries** (what is this directory?), **decisions** (why was it built this way?), and **constraints** (what rules must I follow?). File listings, interfaces, and dependency graphs are omitted — LLMs can get those faster from the source code itself.

### The real cost of file exploration

The token cost of exploring code is worse than it looks. When Claude Code, Cursor, or Copilot reads files to understand a directory, each file read is a tool call — and every tool call replays the entire conversation history. An agent reading 5 files doesn't pay for 5 files. It pays for the first file, then the first *and* second, then all three, and so on:

```
Turn 1:  system + file₁                          →  1 file of context
Turn 2:  system + file₁ + file₂                  →  2 files of context
Turn 3:  system + file₁ + file₂ + file₃          →  3 files of context
Turn 4:  system + file₁ + file₂ + file₃ + file₄  →  4 files of context
Turn 5:  ...                                      →  5 files of context
                                              Total: 15 file-reads of tokens
```

That's `N × (N + 1) / 2` — roughly **3x** the naive "just sum the file sizes" estimate. For a 10-file directory, it's closer to **5.5x**. And this doesn't count the files the agent opens that turn out to be irrelevant, or the imports it follows into other directories.

With `.context.yaml`, the agent reads one small file (~25 lines), gets oriented, and either answers immediately or opens exactly the one file it needs. Two turns instead of ten. The token savings compound with every file the agent *doesn't* have to explore.

## Why `.context.yaml` Instead of `README.md`?

`README.md` is still important, but it solves a different problem.

- **`README.md`** is project-level narrative for humans: onboarding, setup, usage, examples.
- **`.context.yaml`** is directory-level, structured context for agents: what this folder is for, key decisions, constraints, and where to look next.

Why `.context.yaml` helps where README alone does not:

- **Granularity**: one README cannot describe every directory without becoming huge.
- **Machine queryability**: MCP tools can request specific fields (`summary`, `decisions`, `constraints`) instead of dumping full prose.
- **Freshness tracking**: fingerprints provide `fresh`/`stale`/`missing` status per directory.
- **Trust model**: `derived_fields` makes machine-derived vs narrative content explicit.
- **Lean retrieval**: agents can load only the current directory context first, then drill down.

## Core Features

- **Lean by default** — context files contain only what LLMs can't infer from code: summaries, decisions, constraints. Use `--full` for verbose output with file listings, interfaces, and dependencies.
- **Schema validation** — `.context.yaml` files are validated against a strict schema for consistent, machine-readable structure.
- **MCP queryability** — LLM clients can query context through MCP tools instead of scraping text.
- **Field filtering** — `query_context` can return only selected fields (for example `decisions` or `constraints`) to reduce token usage.
- **Fingerprint-based freshness** — each directory has a content fingerprint with `fresh`, `stale`, and `missing` state tracking.
- **`derived_fields` provenance tracking** — machine-derived fields are explicitly marked so agents can distinguish high-confidence facts from narrative.
- **Strict cross-check validation** — `context validate --strict` can detect drift between declared context and actual code.

## How It Compares

| Capability | dotcontext | CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules | Tool-native indexes | Memory tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| What it stores | Factual docs (what code does) | Behavioral rules (how AI acts) | Embeddings / vectors | Conversation history |
| Portable across tools | Yes — plain YAML in git | No — tool-specific | No — proprietary | No — tied to service |
| Git-visible | Yes — committed, diffable | Yes | No | No |
| Works offline | Yes — static analysis default | Yes | Depends | No |
| Machine-queryable | Yes — MCP + schema | No — unstructured | Partial | Partial |
| Staleness detection | Yes — fingerprint-based | No | Varies | N/A |
| Self-maintaining | Yes — embedded instructions | No | Auto-updated | Auto-updated |

**dotcontext is not:**
- An agent framework (no tool calling, no execution)
- A vector database (no embeddings, no semantic search)
- Behavioral rules (that's what CLAUDE.md is for)
- A cloud service (everything local, data stays on disk)

## Comparison Questions

Use these questions when comparing dotcontext with alternatives (tool-native indexes, memory systems, CLAUDE.md-only workflows, etc.):

1. Can I fetch context by **directory** and **field** (not just full-text blobs)?
2. Can I detect **staleness** automatically when code changes?
3. Is the context **git-visible**, diffable, and code-reviewable?
4. Is it **portable across tools** (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, custom MCP clients)?
5. Can I distinguish **machine-derived facts** from narrative summaries?
6. Does it support a **lean mode** for low token overhead, with optional verbose mode?
7. Does it work **offline/local-first** without requiring cloud indexing?
8. Can CI enforce freshness/validity (`status`, `validate`, `doctor`)?
9. Does it complement, rather than replace, human docs like `README.md`?

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g dotcontext

context init                # Generate lean .context.yaml files and AGENTS.md
context status              # Check which files are fresh/stale
context regen --all --stale # Regenerate only what changed
context doctor              # Diagnose setup issues
context show src/core       # Pretty-print a context file
```

Requires Node.js >= 18. No accounts, no cloud services, works fully offline. See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for the full 5-minute guide.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `context init` | Scan project, generate all `.context.yaml` and `AGENTS.md` |
| `context init --llm` | Use LLM for richer summaries, decisions, constraints |
| `context init --full` | Generate verbose context (files, interfaces, dependencies) |
| `context status` | Check freshness of all context files |
| `context status --json` | Machine-readable JSON output for CI |
| `context regen [path]` | Regenerate context for a specific directory (or `--all`) |
| `context regen --stale` | Only regenerate stale or missing directories |
| `context regen --dry-run` | Preview what would be regenerated without changes |
| `context regen --full` | Include files, interfaces, dependencies in output |
| `context regen --parallel <n>` | Process directories concurrently |
| `context doctor` | Check project health: config, API keys, coverage, staleness, validation |
| `context doctor --json` | Machine-readable diagnostics for CI |
| `context rehash` | Recompute fingerprints without regenerating content |
| `context validate` | Schema compliance check |
| `context validate --strict` | Cross-reference against actual source code |
| `context watch` | Real-time staleness monitoring |
| `context show <path>` | Pretty-print a context file |

| `context config --mode <lean\|full>` | Set default generation mode |
| `context ignore <path>` | Add directory to `.contextignore` |
| `context serve` | Start MCP server for LLM tool integration |

All commands accept `-p, --path <path>` to target a specific project root. `init` and `regen` accept `--no-agents` to skip `AGENTS.md` generation, `--evidence` to collect test/typecheck signals, and `--parallel <n>` for concurrent processing.

## Everyday Workflow

```bash
# First run — generate everything (lean by default)
context init

# After editing code — regenerate only what changed
context regen --all --stale

# Preview before regenerating
context regen --all --stale --dry-run

# Speed up with concurrency (especially useful with --llm)
context regen --all --stale --parallel 4

# Generate verbose context with file listings and interfaces
context init --full
context regen --all --full

# Set full mode as the project default
context config --mode full

# Check project health in one command
context doctor

# CI: machine-readable output
context status --json
context doctor --json
```

## Lean vs Full Mode

By default, dotcontext generates **lean** context files — a routing layer that tells LLMs what they need to know without duplicating information available in source code.

**Lean mode** (default) produces:
- `summary` — 1-3 sentences describing the directory's purpose
- `decisions` — architectural choices that can't be inferred from code
- `constraints` — hard rules a developer must follow
- `subdirectories` — routing to child directories with summaries
- `dependencies.internal` — cross-directory import relationships (cheap, high signal for navigation)
- Metadata: `version`, `fingerprint`, `scope`, `maintenance`, `derived_fields`
- Root only: `project`, `structure`

**Full mode** (`--full` flag or `context config --mode full`) adds:
- `files[]` — every file with its purpose
- `interfaces[]` — exported functions, classes, endpoints
- `dependencies.external` — from package manifests
- `current_state` — what's working, broken, in progress

Mode resolution: `--full` CLI flag > `config.mode` > default `lean`.

A typical lean `.context.yaml` is ~20-25 lines vs ~60-80 lines in full mode. The high-value fields stay; the redundant-with-source fields move behind `--full`.

**Static analysis** (default) — no API key, works offline:
- Auto-detected summaries from file structure
- AST-based export detection via tree-sitter (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust) in full mode
- Dependencies from package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod
- Test evidence from existing artifacts (opt-in, `--evidence`)

**LLM-enhanced** (`--llm`) — richer output via configured provider:
- Rich summaries, architectural decisions, and constraints
- In full mode: interface descriptions, current state assessment
- Machine-derived fields always overlay LLM output for accuracy

## MCP Server

Three tools via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (stdio transport):

- **`query_context`** — Retrieve context for a directory, with optional field filtering
- **`check_freshness`** — Check if context is fresh, stale, or missing
- **`list_contexts`** — List all directories with staleness status

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add dotcontext -- context serve --path /path/to/project

# Cursor (.cursor/mcp.json)
{ "mcpServers": { "dotcontext": { "command": "context", "args": ["serve", "--path", "."] } } }
```

See [docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md) for Windsurf, Continue, generic MCP clients, non-MCP usage, and CI/CD setup.

## Configuration

```yaml
# .context.config.yaml (add to .gitignore)
provider: anthropic
model: claude-3-5-haiku-latest
mode: lean          # or "full" for verbose output
ignore: [tmp, scratch]
max_depth: 5
```

| Setting | Values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `ollama` | LLM provider for `--llm` mode |
| `model` | any model ID | Override default model for provider |
| `mode` | `lean` (default), `full` | Default generation mode |
| `ignore` | directory list | Additional directories to skip |
| `max_depth` | integer | Maximum scan depth |
| `api_key_env` | env var name | Custom env var for API key |

| Provider | Default Model | Env Var |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | claude-3-5-haiku-latest | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google | gemini-2.0-flash-lite | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| Ollama | llama3.2:3b | `OLLAMA_HOST` (local, no key) |

```bash
# Set config from CLI
context config --provider anthropic --model claude-3-5-haiku-latest
context config --mode full
context config --ignore tmp scratch
context config              # View current settings
```

## How It Works

**Scanning** — walks the directory tree, finds directories with source files. Skips `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, and 15+ other non-source directories. Respects `.gitignore` and `.contextignore` patterns (exact names, globs, path rules, negation).

**Fingerprinting** — 8-char SHA-256 from sorted `filename:mtime:size`. Cheap (`stat()` only, no file reads). Detects additions, deletions, and modifications.

**Staleness** — `fresh` (fingerprint matches), `stale` (files changed), `missing` (no context file). `context status` checks all; `context watch` monitors live.

**AGENTS.md** — `init` and full-tree `regen` generate an `AGENTS.md` at project root: a directory index with summaries and instructions for reading context files. User content outside the managed section is preserved. Skip with `--no-agents`.

**Self-maintenance** — every `.context.yaml` embeds a `maintenance` field instructing LLMs to update the summary, decisions, and constraints after modifying files. Works across all tools.
