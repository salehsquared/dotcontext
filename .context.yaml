summary: >
  The root directory provides folder-level documentation for LLMs, containing `.context.yaml` files for every
  subdirectory to summarize their purpose and structure, as well as architectural decisions and constraints.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
