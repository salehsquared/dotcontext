summary: >
  The `src/commands` directory houses various command-line interface (CLI) commands that facilitate configuration
  management, context generation, checks, validation, and monitoring of the project structure. Each command allows users
  to interact with context files and project configurations, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the developed
  system.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using a YAML schema for context validation.
    why: This choice ensures that the context files maintain a consistent structure and adhere to predefined specifications,
      which facilitates easier debugging and integrity checks.
    tradeoff: Complexity in implementation and possible performance implications during validation.
constraints:
  - All context files must be in accordance with the defined schema to avoid runtime errors.
  - Commands should handle missing or invalid configurations gracefully to avoid disruption in user experience.
