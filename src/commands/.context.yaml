summary: >
  The `src/commands` directory contains various command implementations for managing context generation, configuration,
  and diagnostics for a project. Each file provides a specific functionality such as initializing configurations,
  running benchmarks, validating context files, and monitoring their freshness.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use a single command pattern for each functionality.
    why: To maintain consistency and ease of use across all commands.
    tradeoff: May lead to a larger number of files, but allows for clearer separation of concerns.
  - what: Default tokens filtering based on a minimum threshold.
    why: To optimize performance and focus on relevant directories.
    tradeoff: Can skip some valid directories if their token counts do not meet the threshold.
constraints:
  - All commands must handle configuration loading and error management consistently.
  - JSON output mode must avoid any additional console output.
