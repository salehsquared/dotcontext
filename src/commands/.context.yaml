summary: >
  This directory contains command modules that facilitate various operations, including configuring settings, generating
  context files, and checking the health of the project structure. Each command interacts with project files and
  configurations to maintain coherence and facilitate user workflows.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The configuration command defaults to the 'anthropic' provider.
    why: This provides a default option that allows users to quickly set up the environment without making immediate
      decisions.
    tradeoff: Users may need to change the provider if they intend to use a different service, increasing initial setup time
      for those who have specific needs.
constraints:
  - Commands require a valid project structure; otherwise, they will return errors or prompts for initialization.
  - The configuration must adhere to the allowed values for provider and mode; invalid inputs will result in errors.
