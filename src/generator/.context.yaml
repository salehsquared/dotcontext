summary: >
  The `src/generator` directory is responsible for generating context YAML files from source code through both static
  analysis and LLM-based methods. It includes functionality to detect exports, dependencies, and other project details
  to create comprehensive context files.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Utilizes WebAssembly-based tree-sitter parsers for analyzing source files.
    why: To enable robust syntax parsing and export detection for multiple programming languages.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity and dependency on WASM files and their availability in the project.
constraints:
  - Requires tree-sitter WASM files to be present in the grammars directory to function correctly.
  - Only supports relative imports for internal dependency detection.
  - Collect evidence for test results only if invoked from the project root.
