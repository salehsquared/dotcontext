scope: src/mcp
summary: >
  The src/mcp directory implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, providing tools to manage and query contextual
  data in project directories.
files:
  - name: server.ts
    purpose: Starts the MCP server and registers tools.
  - name: tools.ts
    purpose: Defines utility functions to handle context queries, check freshness, and list contexts.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the files list, interfaces, and current_state sections.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
interfaces:
  - name: startMcpServer
    description: Initializes and starts the MCP server with the specified root path.
  - name: handleQueryContext
    description: Processes a request to retrieve content from a .context.yaml file based on a given scope.
  - name: handleCheckFreshness
    description: Checks if the .context.yaml file at a specified scope is fresh or requires updates.
  - name: handleListContexts
    description: Lists all directories in the project along with their context status.
  - name: registerTools
    description: Registers various tools with the MCP server for handling context-related operations.
decisions:
  - what: Use of a standard transport layer.
    why: To facilitate communication between the MCP server and external clients using standard input/output.
    tradeoff: Relies on synchronous I/O, which may block when waiting for input.
constraints:
  - Path traversal is not allowed when resolving directory scopes.
  - Must check for the existence of a .context.yaml file before processing context-related requests.
