summary: >
  The `src/mcp` directory implements the Model Context Protocol server, handling context queries, freshness checks, and
  tool registrations for project scopes. It facilitates interaction with `.context.yaml` files and provides structured
  documentation through a JSON-RPC channel.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use of `McpServer` from the SDK
    why: To leverage existing protocols for managing context in a standardized way.
    tradeoff: Introduces dependency on the external SDK but enables integration with a wider ecosystem.
constraints:
  - Paths given to the server must not lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities.
  - A valid `.context.yaml` file must exist at the specified scope for context operations to succeed.
