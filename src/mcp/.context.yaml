summary: >
  This directory implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with tools for querying and managing context files in
  a project. It includes functionalities to check context freshness and list contexts across directories.
files:
  - name: server.ts
    purpose: Starts the MCP server and registers tools.
  - name: tools.ts
    purpose: Contains utility functions and handlers for context management.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the files list, interfaces, and current_state sections.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
interfaces:
  - name: startMcpServer
    description: Initializes and starts the MCP server with the specified root path.
  - name: handleQueryContext
    description: Processes a request to retrieve and filter .context.yaml content for a given scope.
  - name: handleCheckFreshness
    description: Evaluates the freshness of a context file at a specified scope.
  - name: handleListContexts
    description: Lists all contexts in the project, providing details about their state.
decisions:
  - what: Using structured documentation in response to requests.
    why: To provide flexible filtering options for users seeking specific information.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in handling various filters.
