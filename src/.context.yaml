summary: >
  The `src` directory serves as the main entry point for the application, encapsulating the command-line interface (CLI)
  functionality, core processing logic, and utility functions essential for managing and generating .context.yaml files
  for project documentation. It orchestrates various commands that allow users to configure, monitor, and validate
  project states.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The CLI tool is designed with a modular command structure, utilizing handlers for different operations.
    why: This modular approach enhances maintainability and allows easy extension of command capabilities.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in managing multiple command handlers and ensuring consistent interfaces.
constraints:
  - All CLI commands must define clear descriptions and options to ensure usability and clarity for users.
subdirectories:
  - name: commands/
    summary: >
      The `src/commands` directory houses various command-line interface (CLI) commands that facilitate configuration
      management, context generation, checks, validation, and monitoring of the project structure. Each command allows
      users to interact with context files and project configurations, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the
      developed system.
  - name: core/
    summary: >
      This directory contains core functionality for computing directory fingerprints, scanning project structures, and
      managing .context.yaml files. It ensures organized and efficient tracking of project files and their states.
  - name: generator/
    summary: >
      The `src/generator` directory contains code for parsing source files to detect exports and dependencies,
      generating context documentation, and collecting evidence from existing artifacts. It leverages AST parsing and
      static analysis to build structured YAML outputs for project documentation.
  - name: mcp/
    summary: >
      The `src/mcp` directory implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, providing functionality to manage and
      query project context stored in `.context.yaml` files. It establishes a connection via standard I/O and allows
      interaction with the context through various tools.
  - name: providers/
    summary: >
      This directory implements various LLM provider classes that adhere to a common interface, allowing for the
      generation of text responses from different language models. Each provider encapsulates the specifics of
      interacting with an external API or SDK. 
  - name: utils/
    summary: >
      The src/utils directory provides utility functions to manage configuration settings, environment variables, and
      display messages. It includes methods for loading and saving configurations, handling environment variables, and
      processing data in parallel with bounded concurrency.
