summary: >
  This directory contains the core logic for the command-line interface (CLI) of the context management tool,
  facilitating operations such as configuration, context file generation, and project health checks through various
  command modules. It serves as the main entry point for user interactions with the system.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use of a command pattern with modular command handlers
    why: Facilitates extensibility and separation of concerns by allowing individual command modules to handle specific
      functionality.
    tradeoff: Potential increase in complexity for managing multiple files and modules.
constraints:
  - Commands must adhere to the defined interface for handlers.
  - The path option is required for most commands to specify the project root.
subdirectories:
  - name: commands/
    summary: >
      This directory contains command modules that facilitate various operations, including configuring settings,
      generating context files, and checking the health of the project structure. Each command interacts with project
      files and configurations to maintain coherence and facilitate user workflows.
  - name: core/
    summary: >
      The `src/core` directory provides functionalities for computing fingerprints of project directories, managing
      agent markdown files, and scanning project structures to identify directories needing context management. It
      serves as a vital component for maintaining project integrity and facilitating updates.
  - name: generator/
    summary: >
      The `src/generator` directory is responsible for generating context YAML files from source code through both
      static analysis and LLM-based methods. It includes functionality to detect exports, dependencies, and other
      project details to create comprehensive context files.
  - name: mcp/
    summary: >
      The `src/mcp` directory implements the Model Context Protocol server, handling context queries, freshness checks,
      and tool registrations for project scopes. It facilitates interaction with `.context.yaml` files and provides
      structured documentation through a JSON-RPC channel.
  - name: providers/
    summary: >
      This directory contains implementations of various LLM (Large Language Model) providers, each adapted to a common
      interface. It allows for the creation and usage of different models from providers like Anthropic, Google, and
      OpenAI, enabling flexible integration into applications.
  - name: utils/
    summary: >
      The src/utils directory contains utility functions for handling configuration, environment variables, display
      messages, and concurrency. It provides essential helpers to manage application settings and present user messages
      effectively.
