summary: >
  The `src` directory implements a CLI tool for managing folder-level documentation through `.context.yaml` files,
  supporting commands for initialization, regeneration, validation, and more, as well as starting a server for LLM tool
  integration.
files:
  - name: index.ts
    purpose: Entry point for the CLI tool, defining command-line commands and their handlers.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the files list, interfaces, and current_state sections.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
interfaces:
  - name: createProgram
    description: Creates the command-line interface with defined commands for managing context YAML files.
  - name: runCli
    description: Executes the CLI tool with the provided command-line arguments.
decisions:
  - what: Use of the `commander` library for command-line processing
    why: To simplify command definition and parsing of command-line arguments.
    tradeoff: Additional library dependency, but enhances maintainability and readability.
constraints:
  - The CLI must not expose any sensitive information such as API keys or user credentials.
dependencies:
  internal:
    - ./commands/config.js
    - ./commands/ignore.js
    - ./commands/init.js
    - ./commands/regen.js
    - ./commands/rehash.js
    - ./commands/show.js
    - ./commands/status.js
    - ./commands/validate.js
    - ./commands/watch.js
    - ./mcp/server.js
    - ./utils/env.js
current_state:
  working:
    - All defined commands are operational and can be executed via the CLI.
  in_progress:
    - Documentation for additional commands may be expanded in the future.
subdirectories:
  - name: commands/
    summary: >
      The `src/commands` directory contains command implementations for managing and configuring a context-aware system.
      It supports initializing, regenerating, validating, and displaying context configurations.
  - name: core/
    summary: >
      This directory contains functionalities for computing directory fingerprints, scanning project directories, and
      managing context information for files. It includes methods for checking file freshness and identifying source
      code.
  - name: generator/
    summary: This directory contains various modules for generating structured YAML documents, detecting external and
      internal dependencies, and collecting evidence from test artifacts using both static analysis and a language model
      interface.
  - name: mcp/
    summary: >
      The src/mcp directory implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, providing tools to manage and query
      contextual data in project directories.
  - name: providers/
    summary: >
      This directory provides implementations of various large language model (LLM) providers, each adapting specific
      SDKs to a common interface for generating responses based on user input.
  - name: utils/
    summary: >
      The `src/utils` directory contains utility functions for managing configuration, environment variables, ignore
      lists, and displaying status messages in the CLI.
