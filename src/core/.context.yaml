summary: >
  The `src/core` directory provides functionalities for computing fingerprints of project directories, managing agent
  markdown files, and scanning project structures to identify directories needing context management. It serves as a
  vital component for maintaining project integrity and facilitating updates.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using SHA-256 for fingerprint computation
    why: To ensure a reliable and collision-resistant hash for directory content changes.
    tradeoff: Increased computation time due to the algorithm's complexity compared to simpler hash functions.
constraints:
  - The .context.yaml file must not be included in the fingerprint computation.
  - Only source code files and meaningful files count towards fingerprint computation.
