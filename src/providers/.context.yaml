  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using dynamic imports for provider loading
    why: To minimize the initial bundle size and only load the necessary provider when requested.
    tradeoff: It may introduce slight delay during instantiation due to the asynchronous nature of dynamic imports.
constraints:
  - Each provider must implement the LLMProvider interface and adhere to its method signature.
  - API keys or host URLs must be provided for cloud-based providers.
