summary: >
  This directory contains implementations of different LLM (Large Language Model) providers that adhere to a common
  interface. Each provider class is responsible for generating responses from its respective model using either SDKs or
  direct API calls.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The GoogleProvider uses a direct REST API call instead of an SDK.
    why: This choice minimizes dependencies and potentially reduces the overhead of using a full SDK.
    tradeoff: This may result in less convenience and additional manual handling of API details.
constraints:
  - Each provider must implement the LLMProvider interface with the generate method.
