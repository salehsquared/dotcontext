summary: >
  This directory implements various LLM provider classes that adhere to a common interface, allowing for the generation
  of text responses from different language models. Each provider encapsulates the specifics of interacting with an
  external API or SDK. 
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Providers are instantiated dynamically based on a string identifier.
    why: This allows for easy extensibility in supporting additional LLM providers without modifying the core code.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in the provider creation logic may make it less intuitive for new developers.
constraints:
  - API keys must be provided for cloud providers when instantiating the corresponding provider classes.
  - The maximum output tokens for all implementations is hard-coded to 4096.
