summary: >
  This directory contains documentation for using and integrating dotcontext within projects, including CI/CD pipeline
  implementations, integration setups, and user guides. It provides essential guidelines for maintaining context quality
  and leveraging the MCP server functionalities.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The MCP server operates as a read-only service.
    why: To ensure that context files remain unchanged by external interactions, preserving data integrity.
    tradeoff: Clients cannot modify context directly, which may require additional regeneration steps.
constraints:
  - The MCP server validation must occur with validated paths to avoid security issues related to path traversal.
  - Only recognized file types as defined in the documentation will be acknowledged during the context file generation.
