summary: >
  The `docs` directory provides comprehensive information and guidance on using the dotcontext tool, including CI/CD
  integration, usage patterns, limitations, and quickstart instructions for generating and validating context files. It
  serves as a resource for both new users and developers seeking to understand the architecture and operational
  constraints of the tool.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: CI/CD integration should prioritize context validation on pull requests.
    why: To maintain context quality and prevent schema violations before code changes are merged.
    tradeoff: Requires developers to ensure context files are consistently updated, potentially increasing PR complexity.
constraints:
  - Run `context validate` in CI to catch invalid YAML and schema violations for every pull request.
  - Context files must not contain secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII.
