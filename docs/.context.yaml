  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use YAML for .context.yaml files
    why: YAML is human-readable and widely supported by various tools and libraries.
    tradeoff: Requires validation schemas to ensure correctness.
constraints:
  - Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in any context files.
  - All `.context.yaml` files must comply with the defined schema to be valid.
