summary: >
  The scripts directory contains utility scripts for building grammars, generating JSON schemas from Zod schemas, and
  managing local project context settings. These scripts automate essential tasks to facilitate project setup and schema
  management.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The build-grammars script directly copies pre-built WASM grammar files from node_modules.
    why: This choice simplifies the setup by avoiding the need to compile grammars, ensuring they are readily available for
      use.
    tradeoff: While this approach reduces build times, it assumes that the necessary grammar packages are always present in
      node_modules.
constraints:
  - The sync-context.local.sh script requires a project root to function correctly and can only operate within its
    intended context.
