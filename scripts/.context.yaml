summary: >
  The 'scripts' directory contains utility scripts for managing project workflows, including building grammar files,
  generating schemas, and configuring git hooks. These scripts automate essential tasks to ensure smooth development and
  maintenance of the project.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use of Zod for JSON schema generation
    why: Zod offers a straightforward and dependency-free way to create JSON schemas directly from existing validation
      schemas.
    tradeoff: This choice ties the schema generation process to Zod, which may limit flexibility if a different validation
      library is preferred in the future.
constraints:
  - Scripts must be executed from the project root directory to function correctly.
  - The .githooks directory must be configured to ensure that the pre-commit hook is installed properly.
