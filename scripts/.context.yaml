summary: >
  The scripts directory contains utilities for managing grammar files and generating JSON Schema files from Zod schemas.
  These scripts automate the tasks of copying pre-built WebAssembly grammar files and creating schema definitions for
  validation purposes.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The generate-schemas script runs after TypeScript compilation.
    why: This ensures that the Zod schemas are imported from the compiled output.
    tradeoff: This introduces a dependency on the TypeScript build process for generating schemas correctly.
constraints:
  - The copied grammar files must exist in the correct path within node_modules, or they will not be copied.
  - The JSON Schema generation requires Zod version 4 or higher.
