summary: >
  This directory contains scripts to manage grammar files and generate JSON Schema files from Zod schemas. It automates
  the copying of pre-built WASM grammar files to the grammars directory and produces schema files from defined Zod
  schemas.
files:
  - name: build-grammars.mjs
    purpose: Copy pre-built WASM grammar files from node_modules to grammars/.
  - name: generate-schemas.mjs
    purpose: Generate JSON Schema files from Zod schemas.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the files list, interfaces, and current_state sections.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
interfaces:
  - name: build-grammars
    description: Copies specified WASM files for language grammars to the local grammars directory.
  - name: generate-schemas
    description: Generates JSON Schema files from the provided Zod schemas and writes them to the filesystem.
decisions:
  - what: Use Zod's native toJSONSchema() method.
    why: To avoid additional dependencies and simplify the schema generation process.
    tradeoff: Potential limitations based on the capabilities of Zod's schema generation.
constraints:
  - Requires a compiled dist/ directory to import Zod schemas.
current_state:
  working:
    - WASM grammar files can be successfully copied.
    - JSON Schema files can be generated from Zod schemas.
