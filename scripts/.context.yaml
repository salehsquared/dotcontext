summary: >
  The scripts directory contains automation scripts to manage grammar files and generate JSON Schema files from Zod
  schemas.
files:
  - name: build-grammars.mjs
    purpose: Copies pre-built WASM grammar files from node_modules to the grammars directory.
  - name: generate-schemas.mjs
    purpose: Generates JSON Schema files from Zod schemas after TypeScript compilation.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the files list, interfaces, and current_state sections.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
interfaces:
  - name: copyFileSync
    description: Copies WASM files for various programming languages from the node_modules to the grammars directory.
  - name: toJSONSchema
    description: Transforms Zod schemas into JSON Schema format for context and configuration.
decisions:
  - what: Use native Zod's toJSONSchema() function
    why: To avoid additional dependencies while generating JSON Schema.
    tradeoff: Relies on Zod's features; may miss out on specific JSON Schema capabilities not covered by Zod.
current_state:
  working:
    - Build and grammar management scripts execute without errors.
  broken:
    - No known broken functionality.
  in_progress:
    - No current work in progress is noted.
