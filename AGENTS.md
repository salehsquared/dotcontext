## Project Context

This project uses [dotcontext](https://github.com/dotcontext/cli) for structured codebase documentation.

**Every directory with source files contains a `.context.yaml` file.** It describes:

- What the directory contains and its purpose (summary)
- Architectural decisions and constraints (things you can't infer from code)
- Subdirectory routing (what's inside each subdirectory)

### How to Use Context Files

1. **Before exploring a directory**, read its `.context.yaml` summary to understand what it does
2. **Before modifying code**, check `decisions` and `constraints` for rationale and hard rules
3. **After modifying files**, update the summary if the directory's purpose changed
4. **To check freshness**, run `context status` — stale contexts may have outdated information

### Directory Index

### Maintenance

When you significantly change files in a directory, update its `.context.yaml`:
- Update `summary` if the directory's purpose shifted
- Update `decisions` if architectural choices changed
- Update `constraints` if hard rules changed

The `maintenance` field in each `.context.yaml` contains specific instructions.
