  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the files list, interfaces, and current_state sections.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
