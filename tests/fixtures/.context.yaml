scope: tests/fixtures
summary: >
  The tests/fixtures directory contains structured test fixtures to support unit testing across various projects. It
  includes a monorepo structure, a simple project demonstration, and specific test sources to organize and isolate test
  data from application code.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The directory is organized into subdirectories for different types of projects (monorepo, simple, with context
      ignores).
    why: This separation enhances maintainability and clarity, allowing developers to easily find relevant test fixtures for
      different contexts.
    tradeoff: While this adds directory depth, it can also lead to more complexity in navigating the project structure.
constraints:
  - Test fixtures must not interfere with the main application codebase.
subdirectories:
  - name: monorepo/
    summary: >
      This directory contains fixtures for testing within a monorepo structure, facilitating organized testing across
      multiple services by including specific packages like the API server and shared TypeScript types.
  - name: simple-project/
    summary: >
      This directory contains a simple project demonstrating basic functionality with source files for a main function
      and a utility for adding numbers. It is structured to illustrate module usage and TypeScript configuration. 
  - name: with-contextignore/
    summary: >
      This directory serves as a collection of test fixture source files and temporary test fixtures specifically
      designed for unit testing. It ensures that test data is organized and isolated from the main application code,
      promoting clarity in the test suite.
