scope: tests/fixtures
summary: >
  The tests/fixtures directory provides test fixtures for various scenarios, including a monorepo setup, a simple
  TypeScript project, and files designated to be ignored during testing. It serves to facilitate organized testing
  across different project configurations.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using a directory structure that organizes different project scenarios
    why: To streamline the development and testing processes by clearly separating different project configurations and
      their associated test fixtures.
    tradeoff: Potential for increased complexity in navigation if too many scenarios are added.
constraints:
  - Files under with-contextignore should be deliberately ignored during tests to ensure accurate testing outcomes.
subdirectories:
  - name: monorepo/
    summary: >
      This directory contains the configuration for a monorepo setup, supporting multiple packages under a single
      workspace. It allows for organized development and shared components across the entire monorepo.
  - name: simple-project/
    summary: >
      This directory contains a basic TypeScript project setup, including source files and configuration for building
      the project. It serves as a template for understanding TypeScript module structure and compilation options.
  - name: with-contextignore/
    summary: >
      This directory contains test fixtures used in the testing process. It includes source files that may be ignored to
      streamline testing efforts.
