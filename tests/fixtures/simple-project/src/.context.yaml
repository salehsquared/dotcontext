  function for addition. It serves as a foundational example for testing and demonstrating basic TypeScript
  functionality.

  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The decision to separate the main logic and utility functions into distinct files.
    why: This promotes modularity and reusable code components.
    tradeoff: Increased file count which may lead to slight complexity in navigation.
constraints:
  - All exported functions must have clear, descriptive names.
