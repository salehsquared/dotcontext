summary: >
  This directory contains the source files for a simple project, including a main function and a utility for adding
  numbers. It serves as the basic implementation for demonstrating functionality.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The project structure separates core functionality into independent modules.
    why: This promotes modularity and reusability within the code.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in project organization may deter newcomers.
constraints:
  - All exported functions must have clear and descriptive names.
exports:
  - "function main(): string"
  - "function add(a: number, b: number): number"
