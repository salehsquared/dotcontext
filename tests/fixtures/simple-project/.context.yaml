summary: >
  This directory contains a simple TypeScript project setup for foundational testing purposes. It includes configuration
  files for building and managing the project structure, focusing on a minimal codebase that highlights essential
  TypeScript functionality.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The project is set up as a module with 'type' set to 'module' in package.json.
    why: This allows for the use of ES module syntax which is more modern and aligns with future JavaScript standards.
    tradeoff: This choice might limit compatibility with older CommonJS modules without proper transpilation.
constraints:
  - TypeScript's strict mode is enforced, requiring all code to follow strict type-checking rules.
subdirectories:
  - name: src/
    summary: >
      This directory contains the source code for a simple project that includes a main entry function and a utility
      function for addition. It serves as a foundational example for testing and demonstrating basic TypeScript
      functionality.
