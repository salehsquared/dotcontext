  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.

decisions:
  - what: Utilizing workspaces in package.json
    why: To manage multiple packages within a single repository while reducing complexity in dependency management.
    tradeoff: Can lead to increased build times if not managed properly, as all packages are interconnected.
constraints:
  - All packages must adhere to the versioning and dependency rules defined in the monorepo package.json.
subdirectories:
  - name: packages/
    summary: >
