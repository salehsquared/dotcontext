summary: >
  This directory contains packages for a monorepo, including shared TypeScript definitions and an API server. It
  facilitates consistent type usage across packages and manages the core functionality for handling API requests.

  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be

decisions:
  - what: Shared types are defined in a separate package.
    why: To ensure consistency and reusability across different packages in the monorepo.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in managing the shared package but improved maintainability and type safety.
constraints:
  - All packages must adhere to the shared TypeScript definitions to avoid type mismatches.
