summary: >
  This directory contains the packages of a monorepo, including the API package and shared type definitions. It serves
  to encapsulate the API functionality and provide consistent typing across various components of the monorepo.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The API package is structured to handle incoming requests and manage server startup.
    why: This design centralizes API-related functionality, allowing for easier maintenance and clearer separation of
      concerns.
    tradeoff: This may lead to additional complexity in managing server configurations across different environments.
constraints:
  - The shared types must be used consistently across all packages to avoid type mismatches.
subdirectories:
  - name: api/
    summary: >

    summary: >
      This directory hosts shared type definitions for a monorepo, ensuring consistent structure and typing across
      multiple packages. It standardizes configuration interfaces to facilitate better collaboration and
