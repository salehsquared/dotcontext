summary: >
  This directory contains fixtures used for testing within a monorepo structure. It includes specific packages like the
  API server and shared TypeScript types, facilitating organized testing across the services.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Shared TypeScript types should be centralized in the shared/ directory.
    why: This promotes type consistency and reduces duplication across various packages in the monorepo.
    tradeoff: Requires all packages to depend on the shared types, which may introduce overhead if not managed properly.
constraints:
  - Each package must adhere to the defined TypeScript types in the shared/ directory to prevent type discrepancies.
subdirectories:
  - name: api/
    summary: >
      This directory contains the API package for a monorepo, implementing the API server responsible for handling
      incoming requests. It plays a central role in the service architecture by coordinating interactions between
      services.
  - name: shared/
    summary: >
      This directory contains shared TypeScript types used across various packages in a monorepo setup, centralizing
      type definitions to promote consistency and reduce duplication.
