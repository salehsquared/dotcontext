summary: >
  This directory contains the API package of the monorepo, providing the source code necessary for the API server
  implementation. It handles incoming requests and manages server startup on a designated port.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The API server is designed as a standalone package within a monorepo architecture.
    why: This allows for better modularization and easier maintenance of services while promoting code reusability across
      different packages.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in managing inter-package dependencies compared to a single monolithic application.
constraints:
  - The server must listen on the specified port as defined in the configuration.
subdirectories:
  - name: src/
