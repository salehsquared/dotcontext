summary: >
  This directory contains the source code for the API server, which defines the functionality to start an HTTP server on
  a specified port. It serves as the entry point for API-related operations in the monorepo.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The server is designed to log the port it starts on.
    why: This provides immediate feedback for developers when the server is launched, aiding in debugging and configuration.
    tradeoff: This could expose implementation details in production logs if not handled correctly.
constraints:
  - The server must be started on a valid port number.
