summary: >
  This directory contains the implementation of the API server, which is responsible for starting the application and
  handling incoming requests. It serves as a central component in the service architecture of the monorepo.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The server starts on a specified port that is passed as an argument.
    why: This design allows for flexible configuration of the server's running environment.
    tradeoff: Requires the caller to know and provide a valid port number.
constraints:
  - The server must be started with a valid port number greater than 0 and less than 65536.
