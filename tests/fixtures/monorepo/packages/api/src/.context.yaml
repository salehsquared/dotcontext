summary: >
  This directory contains the source code for the API server implementation of the monorepo. It is responsible for
  handling incoming requests and starting the server on a specified port.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The server is started using a simple console log message for status.
    why: This provides a straightforward way to confirm server startup without additional complexity.
    tradeoff: This may not provide sufficient error handling or logging for production use.
constraints:
  - The server must be initialized with a valid port number.
exports:
  - "function start(port: number): void"
