summary: >
  This directory contains shared TypeScript types used across various packages in a monorepo setup, centralizing type
  definitions to promote consistency and reduce duplication.

  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Types are organized in a central location.
    why: To ensure all packages have access to the same type definitions, enhancing interoperability.
    tradeoff: Potentially leads to tighter coupling between packages, as they rely on shared definitions.
constraints:
  - Type definitions must be carefully versioned to avoid breaking changes across dependent packages.
