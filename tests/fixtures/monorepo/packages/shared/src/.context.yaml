summary: >
  This directory contains shared TypeScript types to be used across various packages in a monorepo setup. It centralizes
  type definitions to promote consistency and reduce duplication.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Utilizing TypeScript interfaces for configuration types
    why: Ensures type safety and better developer experience through autocompletion and peer validation.
    tradeoff: Increased initial setup complexity compared to plain JavaScript objects.
constraints:
  - The Config interface must always include 'port' and 'host' properties to ensure compatibility across consuming
    packages.

  - interface Config
