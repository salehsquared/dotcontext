summary: >
  This directory contains shared type definitions used across multiple packages in a monorepo setup. It standardizes
  configuration interfaces to ensure consistent structure and typing throughout the project.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The Config interface is defined in a centralized location.
    why: This promotes reuse and maintainability by having a single source of truth for configuration types.
    tradeoff: Introduces a dependency on the shared package across other packages that require configuration types.
constraints:
  - All shared types must be defined in this directory to maintain consistency across the monorepo.
