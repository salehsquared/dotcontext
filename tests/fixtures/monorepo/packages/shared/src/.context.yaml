summary: >
  This directory contains shared TypeScript type definitions used across the monorepo's packages. It specifically
  defines the `Config` interface for configuration management.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The `Config` interface enforces a specific structure for configuration objects across packages.
    why: This promotes consistency and type safety when managing configuration within the monorepo.
    tradeoff: Requires all packages to conform to this structure, which may limit flexibility in some cases.
constraints:
  - Any configuration implementing the `Config` interface must include both 'port' and 'host' properties.
