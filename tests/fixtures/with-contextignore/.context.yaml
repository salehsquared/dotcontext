summary: >
  This directory contains test fixtures for unit testing purposes, including both permanent and temporary mock data and
  scenarios relevant to the application's context. It provides a structured way to manage and utilize test data during
  the testing process.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using a contextignore pattern for managing temporary fixtures
    why: Allows exclusion of certain files from version control, reducing clutter and focusing on relevant test data.
    tradeoff: May lead to potential confusion if files are unintentionally ignored or if necessary data is not tracked.
constraints:
  - All temporary test fixtures must be placed in the 'tmp/' directory.
