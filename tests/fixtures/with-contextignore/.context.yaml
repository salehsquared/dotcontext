summary: >
  This directory serves as a collection of test fixture source files and temporary test fixtures specifically designed
  for unit testing. It ensures that test data is organized and isolated from the main application code, promoting
  clarity in the test suite.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The test fixtures are separated into 'src' and 'tmp' directories.
    why: This structure allows for a clear distinction between permanent test fixture sources and transient data used during
      testing.
    tradeoff: While this adds organization, it may introduce overhead in managing two separate directories.
constraints:
  - All test fixtures must adhere to naming conventions that clearly indicate their purpose and context.
subdirectories:
  - name: src/
    summary: >

    summary: >
      This directory contains temporary test fixtures specifically used for unit testing within the project. It aids in
