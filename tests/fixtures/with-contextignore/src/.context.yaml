summary: >
  This directory contains test fixtures utilized during the testing process. It specifically includes source files that
  may be ignored in context to focus testing efforts more effectively.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using a contextignore file to exclude certain files or directories from the testing context
    why: To streamline testing by preventing unnecessary files from contributing to the testing context
    tradeoff: May lead to missing coverage on certain edge cases represented by ignored files
constraints:
  - All files intended for testing must reside in the 'tests/fixtures' directory structure.
