summary: >
  This directory contains test fixture source files used for testing purposes. It is structured to allow for easy
  integration and utilization within test cases while maintaining isolation from the main application code.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The fixtures are located within a dedicated 'fixtures' directory.
    why: This organization helps to clearly separate test-related resources from the main application code, making it easier
      to manage and understand the test environment.
    tradeoff: While it adds folder depth, it enhances clarity and reduces the risk of contamination between tests and
      application code.
constraints:
  - All test fixture files must adhere to the naming conventions and structure established in the parent test
    directories.
