summary: >
  This directory contains unit tests for the markdown generation functionality used in the project. It validates the
  correctness of various methods that handle the creation and manipulation of markdown content related to agents and
  their actions.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect

  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: The tests cover various edge cases and expected behaviors for markdown generation functions.
    why: To ensure robustness and correctness in generating markdown output, especially regarding escaping characters and
      handling different input scenarios.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in test cases may lead to longer execution times but provides better assurance of
      functionality.
constraints:
  - Tests must pass for all cases to ensure that changes to the markdown generation logic do not introduce regressions.
