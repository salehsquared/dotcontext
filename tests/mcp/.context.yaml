summary: >
  This directory contains tests for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and tool functionality, ensuring proper
  behavior of server initialization and context handling.
files:
  - name: server.test.ts
    purpose: Tests the startMcpServer function to verify server creation, tool registration, and transport connection.
  - name: tools.test.ts
    purpose: Tests various utility functions for handling context queries, freshness checks, and context listings.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the files list, interfaces, and current_state sections.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
interfaces:
  - name: handleQueryContext
    description: Handles requests to query context data, supporting filters and subdirectory scopes.
  - name: handleCheckFreshness
    description: Checks the freshness of context data against stored fingerprints.
  - name: handleListContexts
    description: Lists all tracked contexts with their freshness statuses.
decisions:
  - what: Used Vitest for testing framework
    why: Vitest provides fast and efficient testing capabilities, integrated with modern JavaScript features.
    tradeoff: Tradeoff may involve switching costs for developers familiar with other testing frameworks.
constraints:
  - Tests must be self-contained and use mocked dependencies to ensure isolation.
  - File structure must adhere to a specific hierarchy for the context queries to function correctly.
dependencies:
  internal:
    - ../../src/core/fingerprint.js
    - ../../src/core/schema.js
    - ../../src/core/writer.js
    - ../../src/mcp/tools.js
    - ../helpers.js
current_state:
  working:
    - All tests pass with expected results for mock implementations.
  broken:
    - N/A
  in_progress:
    - Refactoring tests for improved clarity and maintainability.
