summary: >
  This directory contains tests for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and tools, ensuring functionalities like
  server starting, context handling, and tool registration operate as expected.
files:
  - name: server.test.ts
    purpose: Tests the starting of the MCP server and the registration of tools.
  - name: tools.test.ts
    purpose: Tests various tool functions for handling context queries, freshness checks, and context listing.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the files list, interfaces, and current_state sections.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
interfaces:
  - name: handleQueryContext
    description: Handles queries for context information based on provided filters and scopes.
  - name: handleCheckFreshness
    description: Checks the freshness of the context based on fingerprints of tracked files.
  - name: handleListContexts
    description: Lists contexts being tracked along with their statuses.
decisions:
  - what: Mocks are used for server and transport components.
    why: To isolate tests from actual implementations and focus on the logic being tested.
    tradeoff: This may not cover integration issues that could arise in a real environment.
