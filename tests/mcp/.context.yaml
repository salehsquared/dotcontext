decisions:
  - what: Using Vitest for testing framework
    why: Vitest provides a fast and flexible testing environment suitable for modern JavaScript applications.
    tradeoff: Potential need for developers to familiarize themselves with Vitest if accustomed to other testing frameworks.
constraints:
  - Tests must ensure that no path traversal vulnerabilities are present.
  - Tests must clean up any temporary directories created during execution.
