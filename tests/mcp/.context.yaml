  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.

  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using vitest for testing framework
    why: Vitest provides a fast and efficient testing environment compatible with the project's needs.
    tradeoff: While other frameworks exist, choosing vitest means potential limitations in community support compared to
      more widely used options.
constraints:
  - Tests must mock dependencies to avoid side effects on the filesystem or network.
  - All tests must clean up after themselves, ensuring no state leaks between tests.
