summary: >
  This directory contains unit tests for the core functionality of the markdown writer. It focuses on reading, writing,
  and updating agent-related markdown files, ensuring proper handling of file operations and content management.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using temporary directories for tests
    why: To isolate tests from each other and ensure a clean environment for each test case.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in test setup and teardown.
constraints:
  - Tests must clean up any temporary files created to avoid polluting the filesystem.
  - All test files should follow the naming convention '*.test.ts'.
