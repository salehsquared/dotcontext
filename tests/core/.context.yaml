summary: >
  The tests/core directory contains tests for the core functionality of the markdown writer module. It verifies the
  reading, writing, and updating of AGENTS.md files in various scenarios to ensure data integrity and expected behavior.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use of temporary directories for file manipulation during tests
    why: To avoid conflicts with existing files and ensure a clean testing environment
    tradeoff: Increased setup and teardown time due to filesystem operations
constraints:
  - Tests must clean up any temporary files created during execution to prevent pollution of the filesystem
  - Each test case must be isolated and should not depend on the results of other tests
