summary: >
  This directory contains tests for the benchmarking and evaluation features of the codebase, validating the
  functionality of various modules such as Git commit extraction, dependency building, task generation, and scoring
  methods. The tests ensure reliability and correctness of the functions managing code analysis and reporting.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use of Vitest for testing framework
    why: Vitest offers a fast testing experience with a familiar API for developers already acquainted with Jest, making it
      easy to write and maintain tests.
    tradeoff: While Vitest is performant, it may have some limitations in terms of ecosystem maturity compared to other
      established frameworks.
constraints:
  - Tests must be isolated and not depend on the state of the filesystem outside of created temporary directories.
  - All tests must clean up after execution, ensuring no side effects impact subsequent tests.
