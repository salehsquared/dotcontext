summary: >
  The tests/bench directory contains unit tests that evaluate the functionality and performance of the components in the
  bench module. It ensures that features related to git operations, task generation, scoring, and prompt building work
  as intended and meet specified requirements.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use Vitest as the testing framework
    why: Vitest is designed for Vite and provides fast and efficient testing capabilities for modern JavaScript projects.
    tradeoff: It may require developers to learn its specific syntax and features compared to more commonly used frameworks
      like Jest.
constraints:
  - Tests must clean up any temporary resources created during execution to avoid side effects.
  - Each test should run independently to ensure no shared state interferes with test outcomes.
