summary: >
  This directory contains unit tests for utility functions in the codebase, ensuring correctness and performance of
  functionalities such as pool processing and token estimation. It leverages the Vitest framework for running
  asynchronous tests with various scenarios.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use of concurrency control in poolMap
    why: To manage the execution of multiple asynchronous operations efficiently, limiting the number of concurrent
      executions to avoid overwhelming resources.
    tradeoff: While this improves performance, it introduces complexity in managing the concurrency and possible race conditions.
constraints:
  - All tests must clean up temporary directories after execution to avoid side effects on subsequent tests.
