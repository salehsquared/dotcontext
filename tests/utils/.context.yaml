summary: >
  This directory contains utility tests that validate the behavior of helper functions, such as concurrency management
  and token estimation from file sizes. These tests ensure correctness and performance of utility methods used
  throughout the codebase.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using concurrency management in poolMap function
    why: To optimize processing of arrays by controlling the number of simultaneous executions of async functions.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in handling concurrency limits and potential error propagation.
constraints:
  - All tests must assert expected outcomes to ensure utility functions behave correctly under various scenarios.
  - Temporary directories created in tests must be cleaned up after each test run to avoid interference.
