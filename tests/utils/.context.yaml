interfaces:
  - name: poolMap
    description: Processes an array of items with a worker function while respecting a concurrency limit.
decisions:
  - what: Use of Vitest for testing framework
    why: Vitest provides a fast and efficient testing environment suitable for async tests.
    tradeoff: May necessitate learning a new framework if the team is accustomed to another.
constraints:
  - Concurrency limit cannot exceed the number of items being processed.
dependencies:
  internal:
    - ../../src/utils/pool.js
current_state:
  working:
    - Tests verify correct processing of items and concurrency behavior.
