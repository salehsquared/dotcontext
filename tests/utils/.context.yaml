summary: >
  The tests/utils directory contains utility test cases for functions related to concurrency management and token
  estimation within files and directories. It aims to ensure that utility functions behave as expected under various
  conditions.

  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using Vitest for testing framework
    why: Vitest provides a fast and efficient test runner that integrates well with current development practices.
    tradeoff: Choosing Vitest may limit integration options with other testing tools that prefer different frameworks.
constraints:
  - The test environment must support asynchronous testing patterns to correctly handle the promise-based functions.
