  management, initialization, and validation within the context of a software project. It ensures the integrity and
  correctness of command behaviors through automated testing using Vitest.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Using temporary directories for tests
    why: To isolate tests and prevent side effects from shared state.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in test setup and teardown.
constraints:
  - Tests must clean up after themselves to avoid polluting the filesystem.
  - Input data used in tests must be valid and conform to expected formats.
