summary: >
  This directory contains unit tests for command functionalities within the application, ensuring that commands execute
  correctly and handle various scenarios as expected. It promotes code reliability and helps catch regressions early in
  the development process.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Mocking the console.log and process.stdout functions
    why: To capture output for assertions during the tests without relying on actual console output.
    tradeoff: Increased complexity in test setup and teardown due to the need to restore original functions.
constraints:
  - Tests must not rely on external state or side effects; all operations should be performed in a temporary directory.
