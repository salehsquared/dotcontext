summary: >
  This directory contains test cases for various command functionalities, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
  commands related to configuration, initialization, status checking, and regeneration within the project. It
  encompasses unit tests using Vitest to validate individual command behaviors in isolation.
maintenance: |-
  If you modify files in this directory, update this .context.yaml to reflect
  your changes. Update the summary, and any decisions or constraints that changed.
  Do NOT update the fingerprint manually — run `context rehash` or it will be
  updated automatically on the next `context status` check.
  If you only read files in this directory, do not modify this file.
  Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or PII in this file.
decisions:
  - what: Use Vitest as the testing framework
    why: Vitest offers fast, lightweight testing with native ESM support and a familiar API for developers.
    tradeoff: May require additional setup for compatibility with existing codebase if previously using a different framework.
constraints:
  - Tests must not contain side effects that impact other tests.
  - Each test must clean up any temporary files or directories it creates to avoid interference with subsequent tests.
